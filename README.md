DTEK0068 Final project
======================

This project is a repository holding the code for my final project
of course DTEK0068 "Embedded Microprocessor Systems" for year 2020.

What is this?
-------------

This project is a simple shell program for the ATmega4809 Curiosity Nano
that can be accessed via USB-to-serial link.

Possible future modifications
-----------------------------

* Make use of more advanced features like TCA's PWM generation.
* Fix lingering bugs like command `RESET` not working properly.
* Expand line editing capabilities on the shell (e.g. introduce ability to move the cursor.)
